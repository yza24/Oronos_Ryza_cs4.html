            The Bicol region was known as Ibalong, variously interpreted to derive form ibalio, "to bring to the other side"; ibalon, "people from the other side" or <br>
            "people who are hospitable and give visitors gifts to bring home"; or as a corruption of Gibal-ong, a sitio of Magallanes, Sorsogon where the Spaniards <br>
            first landed in 1567. The Bicol River was first mentioned in Spanish documents in 1572. The region was also called Los Camarines after the huts found by <br>
            the Spaniards in Camalig, Albay. No prehistoric animal fossils have been discovered in Bicol and the peopling of the region remains obscure. The Aeta from <br>
            Camarines Sur to Sorsogon strongly suggest that aborigines lived there long ago, but earliest evidence is of middle to late Neolithic life.

        Albay is a beautiful province located in the Bicol Region, known to the world as the home of Mt. Mayon, the volcano with a perfect shape <br>
        of a cone. It is a relatively unspoiled region in south Luzon, with many natural wonders including beaches, springs, caves and waterfalls. <br>
        Albay offers almost endless discoveries, especially for the nature-loving traveler.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: larger;" align="center"> 
        The province is one of the smallest in the Philippines but its size has never stopped it from offering ultimate adventures for its visitors. <br>
        Its major city, Legazpi, lies in the foothills of the majestic Mayon Volcano. Whether it is in its active or dormant state, the volcano’s <br>
        beauty is breathtaking, even comparable to that of Japan’s Mount Fuji.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: larger;" align="center">
        Just like most Filipinos, the people of Albay are fond of merrymaking and celebrations. One of the best times to experience this distinct <br>
        Filipino trait is during the Magayon Festival in May. Marked by trade fairs, cultural events and parades, the festival revolves around the <br>
        folklore about the origin of the Mayon Volcano. Legend has it that the mountain used to be the grave of the lady Daragang Mayon and the <br>
        clouds kissing its peak are the spirit of her lover Pangarnoron. This cultural festival is held annually in the month of May.
